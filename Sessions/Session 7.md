[[The Inevitable]] and [[Skeletal Creature]] are fighting within the underground spaceship. The [[Player Characters]] jump across gears and platforms to get to the other side while avoiding attacks and environmental effects.  [[Athena]] was temporarily deafened by a thunder clap. [[Nip]] was magically Held, but was able to eventually break free.  [[Skewer]] was struck by a void shard and went into critical condition. A void rift "opened" on his face and you could see the stars on his face.  [[Scrat]] was pierced by the hand of the [[Skeletal Creature]] with a [[Blade of Disaster]] attached to it. [[Light]] helped [[Scrat]] up and touches the [[Blade of Disaster]] on the hand and absorbs it to gain a 9th level spell slot.  [[Light]] was temporarily blinded by a light beam.  All of the [[Player Characters]] make it to the end of the tunnel and enter the Biomechanical Room.
