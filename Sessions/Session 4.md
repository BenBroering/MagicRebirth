Session 4 Brass tells the party there's only a handful of kobalds that stole the magic item. he cant say any more but that the magic item will be easily spotted when we see it. and that it is to power the main "furnace" area. The party heads into the tunnels as it twists and turns. as the party continues the ground feels more dens than clay but not metal. the tunnel looks like it was drilled to a point like someone was minning down hear. Runes around the area like there is a trap or a hidden door. the Tunnel is made out of something that looks like a carapace. the body of an insect of some kind. Silvi and Light combined figure out that the runes are a acient locking system. if the party Fails to unlock the system an alarm system is armed. there are seven runes and one says open in the common language. there are pressure pads on the ground that activate the runes. the Door way is an INanis structure and has Abjuration magic infused in it. A humanoid face imurges out of the identification magic and asks what we are doing. He is an Inanis assistant. the structure is an Inanis ship. Light says "Open" to the Door as Skrat steps on the open plate. Skrat in all his genius figures out the puzzle and with the help of freinds opens the door into this open cavern. Spiralling land Bridges crosses all around the cavern. A glow emminated from a center pond from the center of the area. the small flow of water sound filling the room. A large spralling castle made of coral on a landing reaching from ceiling to floor flowing downward like a waterfall.
